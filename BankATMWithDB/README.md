# ATMConsole_With_OOP

- If user key in the wrong pin more than 3 times, the bank account will be locked.

#### Assumption:
- All bank account are the from the same bank

#### Enhancement (To Do):
- Some generic input validation methods to handle any data type, input length and input label.

- LINQ to object (LINQ Query syntax)
- List
- static
- this
- field
